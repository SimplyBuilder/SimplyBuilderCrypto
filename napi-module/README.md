### Features

- **Hashing**: Conversion of strings into hashes using MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512 algorithms.
- **UUID v4**: Generation of version 4 UUIDs.
- **Random Bytes**: Generation of random bytes with customizable length, with a minimum and default value of 32 bytes.

### Installation

This module is designed for direct inclusion in backend projects. It can be installed using npm or other package managers:

#### Using npm

```bash
npm install @jamilservices/sb-module-crypto-back
```

#### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @jamilservices/sb-module-crypto-back
```

#### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @jamilservices/sb-module-crypto-back
```

Then, you can import it into your backend project:

```javascript
const SimplyBuilderCrypto = require('@jamilservices/sb-module-crypto-back');
const { hashMD5, hash256, hash512, base64Encode, base64Decode, randomUUIDV4, randomBytes } = SimplyBuilderCrypto;
```

Or using object destructuring:

```javascript
const { hashMD5, hash256, hash512, base64Encode, base64Decode, randomUUIDV4, randomBytes } = require('@jamilservices/sb-module-crypto-back');
```
